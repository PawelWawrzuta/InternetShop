This file will contain descriptions of some of the database fields 
in order to make their existence clear. 

--------------
=== Client ===
--------------
Client.IsConstClient 	-> defines, wheteher the client can get a discount while shopping -> True/False value.


--------------
=== Order ===
--------------
Order.SentToAddress 	-> stores serialized Client's address 
Order.IsInvoiced 	-> defines if an Invoice should be included
Order.Invoice		-> stores an image/pdf Invoice
Order.InvoiceCopy	-> stores an image/pdf Invoice copy

------------------------       ------------------
=== ProductParameter ===  and  === Parameter ===
------------------------       ------------------     

Parameter-ProductParameter-Product construction is used
to store multiple properties of a product. 
E.g. 
A CPU has Parameters like "Timing" and "Amount of threads" 
that should be described in the database.
A RAM Memory also has "Timing" but doesn't include threads.
Thus, we create a set of attribute names in Parameters table, 
then, as we add products we can add a value to the given Parameter 
that belongs to the given Product. Using this, two products that 
include the same parameter might have two completely different values
regarding the parameter.

--To think about--
Product table could also contain "Performance" column that would store 
all of the Parameters marked with ProductID, serialized into a single 
TEXT (JSON?) in order to improve the performance of the database.
This will require some triggers on Insert and Update tho.

-----------
=== VAT ===
-----------
The table stores the tax value, that should be included
during construction of an order. 
It's sorted using the dates when given VAT value was set by the law.
